/**
 * RuleOverride is a Kraken feature, that lets override validation failures.
 * Validation failures can occur only on validation rules.
 * Validation can be invalidated or ignored or be overriden.
 * To know was rule overriden or not, from Kraken engine rule evaluation result
 * comes as it is (failed or succeed).
 * Raw results reduced with {@link FieldMetadataReducer} can be interpreted with rule override SPI.
 * ({@link IsRuleOverridden}). This SPI provides all required information {@link OverridableRuleContextInfo}
 * for engine invoker to determine was rule overriden or not.
 * If this SPI returns true, that means - rule was overriden and validation failure can be ignored.
 * Please see the diagram below, that explains this process. (it is be rendered on a static html)
