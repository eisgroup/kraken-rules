> Be aware when creating date-time without explicit time zone, date-time will be created with a working machine time zone shift. For UI engine it is browser timezone, for server it is server timezone. It may cause different behaviour depending on execution runtime.
It is not recommended to create a date-time without a time zone as `2021-01-01T01:01:01`. It is recommended to create date-time with a time zone as `2021-01-01T01:01:01Z` instead. Using this function with the string containing time zone will have deterministic behaviour.
